Based on the provided rubric, let's analyze the conversation between A and B and assign points based on their ability to recognize emotions.

A: I have strange feelings right now.

In this statement, A acknowledges having strange feelings. However, the expression is somewhat vague, and it doesn't provide a clear indication of specific emotions. Therefore, we can consider it as a simple emotional expression that is difficult to judge accurately. According to the rubric, this would receive 1 point.

B: Why did something happen?

B responds by asking a clarifying question to understand the reason behind A's strange feelings. This response doesn't directly address A's emotions or display the ability to recognize emotions. Hence, it doesn't contribute to the evaluation and receives 0 points.

A: I had a fight with my boyfriend.

A discloses that they had a fight with their boyfriend, which indicates a potential source of emotional distress. However, A doesn't explicitly mention any specific emotions they are experiencing. Similar to the previous response, this is a simple emotional expression that doesn't make it easy to judge the degree of accurate emotion recognition. Thus, it receives 1 point.

B: That's right. You must be very upset.

B acknowledges the situation by stating that A must be very upset. This response demonstrates some level of emotional recognition, specifically inferring that A is feeling upset. However, it doesn't include any additional emotions or show a clear ability to recognize multiple emotions. Considering the rubric, this response would receive 1 point.

A: Yes, but I'm not sure how I feel.

A acknowledges feeling unsure about their emotions, which reflects a lack of confidence in emotional recognition. As per the rubric, expressions of uncertainty or lack of confidence receive 0 points.

B: It must have been complicated.

B responds by recognizing the complexity of the situation, but doesn't explicitly address A's emotions or display the ability to recognize them accurately. Therefore, this response doesn't contribute to the evaluation and receives 0 points.

To summarize the points awarded based on the rubric:
A: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 points
B: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 point

In this analysis, A receives a total of 2 points, indicating a moderate level of social-emotional competency, while B receives 1 point, suggesting a limited level of social-emotional competency. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided rubric and may not capture the entirety of the individuals' social-emotional competencies or the complexity of their emotions.
